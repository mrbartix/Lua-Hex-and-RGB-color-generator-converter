# Lua Hex and RGB color generator converter

A random lua project that I have made, it can convert HEX color codes to RGB and in reverse, and also generate a random color.

**I used an utility called [ansicolors.lua](https://github.com/kikito/ansicolors.lua) made by kikato that prints things the console in color**
